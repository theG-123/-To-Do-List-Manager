# Description: Build a to-do list manager application that allows users to create, update, and delete tasks. The application should
# support features like categorizing tasks, setting deadlines, marking tasks as complete, and searching/filtering tasks.
# Skills practiced: Object-oriented programming (OOP), file I/O, data manipulation, user input validation, basic CRUD operations.

# Bonus features:
# Reminders: Implement reminders for upcoming deadlines or tasks.
# User authentication: Add user authentication to allow multiple users to have their own to-do lists.
# Priority levels: Allow users to assign priority levels to tasks and sort/filter tasks based on priority.
# These projects offer a good balance of complexity and learning opportunities, allowing you to apply various Python concepts and 
# libraries while building useful applications. Feel free to start with one project and gradually move to the other as you gain
# confidence and proficiency in Python programming.


def categorize_tasks():
    print ('This is the function that will let users sort their different tasks into categories')
    #For example: Sports, School, Coding, Homework/AfterSchool

def create_task():
    print ('Function to create tasks')
    #In this function, include a feature that asks how important is each task. There will be three levels:
    #Urgent: Tasks that need immediate attention or must be done as soon as possible.
    #Priority: Tasks that are important but not urgent, requiring attention in the near future.
    #Casual: Tasks that are less urgent or can be done at leisure when there is ample time available.
